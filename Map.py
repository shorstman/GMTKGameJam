"""
As the player moves, we aren't really drawing the map around them, but rather a series of objects on a background
So what we really want is to determine the relative coordinates of all objects and draw them at those relative coordinates IFF the relative coordinates
are contained within the screen area, determined by (playerX-screenWidth/2,playerY+screenHeight/2),(playerX+screenWidth/2,playerY-screenHeight/2)
    These are the top left and right bottom corners respectively.

Actually I want to make it so that the player can move around a preset area, but when they move outside of that area, it shifts the map.
The area will be predefined by the above formula minus some constant so that we have a border

So
